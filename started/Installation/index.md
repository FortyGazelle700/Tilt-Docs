# Installation

## Installer [!badge variant="primary" text="Recommended"]

Using an installer to install Tilt is the recommended method for most users as it automates the process of setting up Tilt and its dependencies on your computer. The installer will handle downloading and installing the necessary files, configuring the system, and setting up the environment variables. This makes the process of getting Tilt up and running on your computer as simple and straightforward as possible.

## Manual Installation / Source Code [!badge variant="warning" text="For Advanced Users"]

However, if you prefer more control over the installation process or if you want to access the source code and potentially contribute to Tilt development, you can download the source code from the official Tilt website or from a repository such as GitHub, and build Tilt from source. This requires you to download the necessary files and set up the environment variables yourself. Building Tilt from source can also be useful if you want to install Tilt in a non-default location or if you want to make custom configurations.

It is important to note that building Tilt from source can be more complex and time-consuming, and it is recommended for advanced users with a good understanding of the system configuration, but it gives you the flexibility to access and modify the source code. And also, Tilt is open-source, so you can contribute to it via the Tilt's GitHub repository by submitting pull requests, reporting bugs, and suggesting new features.
