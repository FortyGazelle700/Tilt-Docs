Before you can start using Tilt, you need to make sure that you have the following software installed on your computer:

- JDK 15 or later. Tilt requires a recent version of the Java Development Kit (JDK) to be installed in order to run.
  - [Install JDK from Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/jdk15-downloads.html)
  - [Install OpenJDK from Azul](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-15-mts&package=jdk)

To check if you have JDK 15 installed on your computer, open a command prompt or terminal window and type the following command:

```sh
java -version
```

This should display the version of Java that is currently installed on your computer. If the version displayed is less than 15, you'll need to download and install the latest version of JDK 15 from one of the links above.

Once you have JDK 15 installed, you're ready to start using Tilt.

Please make sure you have JDK 15 installed before proceeding.
