Tilt is designed to work seamlessly with popular integrated development environments (IDEs) such as WebStorm, and Visual Studio Code. These IDEs offer a variety of plugins and extensions that can enhance your Tilt development experience. For example, you can use Tilt's official plugins to automatically format your code, navigate through your codebase, and debug your Tilt applications.

Using a Tilt plugin for your preferred IDE can greatly improve your productivity and make it easier to write and understand your code. The Tilt's plugins often provide features such as auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and error checking, which can help you catch mistakes before they become bugs. Additionally, many Tilt's plugins integrate with version control systems, so you can easily collaborate with other developers.

It is recommended to explore the available Tilt's plugins for your preferred IDE and install the ones that best suit your needs. Keep in mind that these Tilt's plugins are usually maintained by the Tilt's team, so they are always up-to-date, so it's important to check the plugin's documentation and compatibility with the version of Tilt you are using. Although, you can use other applications, but they may not provide the same level of integration and support as the Tilt's official plugins, and may not be as efficient and user-friendly.

While Tilt is compatible with a variety of popular integrated development environments (IDEs), it's worth noting that you may have your own preferences or specific needs that may not be met by these IDEs. If that's the case, it's worth looking into other IDEs that may better suit your needs. It's important to research the available options and choose an IDE that provides the functionality you need to be productive and efficient. It's also worth noting that many IDEs have Tilt plugins or extensions available, so even if an IDE is not explicitly designed for Tilt development, it may still be a viable option.

If you want an IDE to be supported by the offical Tilt Team feel free to message us and we will consider it!
