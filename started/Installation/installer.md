# Installation via Installer [!badge variant="primary" text="Recommended"]

1. Navigate to the [installers](installers) and download the one for your system
2. Once downloaded, locate the installer package (most likely in your downloads folder) and double click on it to start the installation process.
3. Allow the prompts in the installer to select the installation location, configure any additional settings, and begin the installation.
4. The installer will copy the necessary files to your computer and set up the necessary configurations.

Once the installation is complete, you should be able to start using Tilt by running the Tilt command from the command line.
It is important to note that these steps may vary depending on the specific installer you are using, but the general process should be similar.
