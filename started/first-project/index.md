# The First Project

For your first Tilt project, we will be guiding you through the process of building a simple command-line interface (CLI) application. This project will introduce you to the basic concepts of Tilt and help you understand how to use the language to create a functional CLI application. The project will cover topics such as setting up the development environment, creating a basic layout, and implementing basic functionality. By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of the Tilt language and how to use it to build CLI applications. You will also have a working CLI application that you can continue to build on and expand in future projects. So, let's get started and create something amazing with Tilt!
