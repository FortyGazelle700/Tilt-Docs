# Setting Up Sublime Text

Unfortunately, at the moment we do not have any official support for any Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for Tilt. We recommend using a text editor of your choice and compiling the code through command line. However, we are always working on expanding our support and welcome any suggestions or requests for specific IDE support.
